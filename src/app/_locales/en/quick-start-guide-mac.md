### Welcome to this project, you will need two main steps to make the extension work:

- **Open the App and set a directory**

  - This directory is used to saving and loading your userscripts.
  - A default local directory is already set when you first launch the App.
  - Click the current directory to jump to the default directory or the one you set.

- **Enable the extension in Safari**

  - Enable Userscripts in Safari extensions list
  - For optimal experience it's recommended that you `Always Allow` Userscripts for `All Websites`, but you could also allow only the sites you want, but please don't forget your settings when your script doesn't work.

Thatâ€™s it, start improving your quality of life now!
